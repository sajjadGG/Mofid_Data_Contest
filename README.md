# Mofid_Data_Contest
My code for the Mofid Data Contest, which includes several questions to evaluate candidates for a Data Science position.
- Problem 2: implement the nearest neighbor algorithm using NumPy.
- Problem 3: simple prediction model using scikit learn package.
- Problem 4: prediction model with some preprocessing like encoding categorical features both original and cardinal (order matters: map to numerical features, order doesn't matter: map to one-hot encoding) and using dimensionality reduction techniques like SVM with sparse vector representation. And Training a Random Forest Algorithm on these features.
- Problem 5: Write a simple Autocorrection using edit distance as a measure of similarity and for term frequency and probability a Shakspeare corpus is used.
- Problem 6: Predicting Emotion using Audio Sample, This task has been done with various models and features first a prior on the different class has been set and then a Linear SVM has been trained on the features extracted from the Audio files. In addition, a neural net has also been trained on these training examples.
